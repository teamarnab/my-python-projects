# Caesar Cipher in Python

## Description
This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher in Python, which is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features
- Encrypts and decrypts messages using a Caesar cipher.
- Allows the user to specify the shift value.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/teamarnab/my-python-projects/tree/main/Ceaser's%20Cipher
2. Navigate into the project directory: cd caesar-cipher
3. There are no external dependencies, as the project only uses built-in Python libraries.

## Usage

1. Open the Python script (`caesar_cipher.py` or your filename).
2. Run the script using: python caesar_cipher.py
3. Follow the prompts to enter the message and shift value for encryption or decryption.

Example:
Enter the message to encrypt: Hello World Enter shift value: 3 Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog
Enter the message to decrypt: Khoor Zruog Enter shift value: 3 Encrypted message: Hello World
